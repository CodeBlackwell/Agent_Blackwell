# Modular Agent System

## 🦖 Welcome to CodeRex: The Future of Autonomous Development

> *"While others talk about AI coding assistants, we're building the autonomous development teams of tomorrow."*

### 🌐 The ACP Revolution Has Begun

Three months ago, the internet gained a new protocol layer: **ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)**. Like HTTP transformed human web interaction, ACP is transforming agent-to-agent communication. We're not just early—we're **pioneering**.

This isn't another "AI writes code" tool. This is **CodeRex**—a battle-tested orchestration system where specialized AI agents collaborate like a real development team, with:

- 🧠 **6+ Specialized Agents** vs Codex's basic 2-3 agent setup
- 🚀 **Horizontal Scalability** through Factory Agents that spawn parallel "Orchestras" 
- 💰 **Intelligent Cost Optimization**: Deploy cheap models for boilerplate, bring in Claude/Opus for the complex stuff
- 🔓 **100% Open Source** vs proprietary black boxes
- 🐳 **Real Execution & Validation** in Docker environments
- 🧪 **True TDD** with actual test execution, not just test generation

### 🎯 Why This Matters

**The Problem**: Current AI coding tools (Codex, Copilot, etc.) are:
- Limited to single LLMs (usually OpenAI's inferior coding models)
- Confused by complex tasks due to oversimplified agent architectures  
- Expensive because they can't intelligently route tasks to appropriate models
- Closed source, leaving you dependent on corporate APIs

**Our Solution**: A modular multi-agent orchestra where:
- **Planner agents** decompose your "build me a full-stack app" into parallel workstreams
- **Factory agents** spin up specialized teams for frontend, backend, and database
- **Smart routing** sends simple tasks to GPT-4o-mini while complex logic goes to Claude Opus
- **Everything runs locally** with your choice of LLMs

### 🏗️ Built for Builders

This isn't just a tool—it's **foundational infrastructure** for the agentic future. While ACP documentation is practically non-existent, this codebase serves as:
- ✅ Production-ready boilerplate for ACP development
- ✅ Reference implementation of multi-agent orchestration patterns
- ✅ Battle-tested workflow management for autonomous teams
- ✅ Your springboard into the $100B+ autonomous agent economy

A modular multi-agent system built on the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) that orchestrates specialized AI agents to collaborate on software development tasks. Features a highly modular workflow architecture with advanced visualization capabilities.

## 🌟 Overview

This system implements a team of specialized AI agents that work together to complete software development tasks. Each agent has a specific role in the development process, from planning to review, and communicates through a standardized protocol. The system features a modular workflow architecture that visualizes data flows between agents for better understanding and debugging.

## 🤖 Architecture

The system is built on a modular, single-server architecture that coordinates a team of specialized AI agents. The core components are:

- **Orchestrator Agent**: The central coordinator that manages the entire workflow. It uses an `EnhancedCodingTeamTool` to dynamically execute workflows and track progress.
- **Specialized Agents**: A team of agents, each responsible for a specific task:
    - **Planner**: Creates detailed project plans and task breakdowns.
    - **Designer**: Develops technical designs, architecture, and database schemas.
    - **Coder**: Implements the code based on the provided plans and designs.
    - **Test Writer**: Creates comprehensive test suites for the implemented code.
    - **Reviewer**: Provides code reviews, feedback, and suggestions for improvement.

## Workflow Execution

The system's workflow execution is managed by a sophisticated, multi-layered process:

1.  **`EnhancedCodingTeamTool`**: The orchestrator receives a task and uses this tool to initiate a workflow. The tool is responsible for setting up progress tracking, managing the session, and generating final reports.
2.  **`workflow_manager.py`**: This module acts as a dispatcher. It receives the workflow request from the `EnhancedCodingTeamTool` and calls the appropriate workflow function based on the user's selection (`TDD`, `Full Development`, or `Individual Step`).
3.  **Workflow Modules**: Each workflow is implemented in its own dedicated module (e.g., `tdd_workflow.py`), ensuring a clean separation of concerns and making it easy to add new workflows in the future.

This architecture allows for a flexible and extensible system where workflows can be easily modified or added without changing the core orchestration logic.

## ✨ Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Each agent is a self-contained module, making it easy to update, test, and replace individual components.
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Supports multiple development workflows, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), Full Development, MVP Incremental with automatic requirement expansion, and individual step execution.
- **Advanced Progress Tracking**: A comprehensive progress tracking system that monitors each step of the workflow, records performance metrics, and generates detailed reports.
- **Workflow Visualization**: Includes tools to generate visual diagrams of the workflows, providing a clear overview of the data flow between agents.
- **Centralized Configuration**: All LLM configurations, including prompts and model parameters, are managed in a central location for consistency and easy maintenance.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: The system includes a full suite of tests for each agent and workflow, ensuring reliability and stability.

## 🎯 MVP Incremental TDD Workflow

The system includes an enhanced MVP Incremental workflow with Test-Driven Development that intelligently expands vague requirements into multiple well-defined features.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Requirement Expansion**: Vague requirements like "Create a REST API" are automatically expanded into 7+ detailed features
- **Template-Based Expansion**: Built-in templates for REST APIs (7 features), Web Apps (6 features), and CLI Tools (6 features)
- **Intelligent Feature Extraction**: Multiple strategies to extract features from design output
- **Full TDD Cycle**: Each feature goes through Write Tests → Run Tests (Fail) → Implement → Run Tests (Pass) → Review
- **Feature Dependencies**: Automatic ordering of features based on dependencies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Each feature gets its own test suite with edge cases and error conditions

### Example: REST API Expansion

**Before Enhancement:**
```
Input: "Create a REST API"
Output: 1 monolithic implementation file
```

**After Enhancement:**
```
Input: "Create a REST API"
Output: 7 modular features:
1. Project Foundation - Framework setup and configuration
2. Database Models - Data persistence layer
3. Authentication System - JWT-based auth
4. CRUD API Endpoints - RESTful operations
5. Input Validation - Request validation
6. Test Suite - Comprehensive tests
7. API Documentation - OpenAPI/Swagger
```

### Running the Enhanced Workflow

```bash
# Using the orchestrator
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/acp/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool": "EnhancedCodingTeamTool",
    "arguments": {
      "requirements": "Create a REST API",
      "workflow_type": "mvp_incremental_tdd"
    }

python tests/run_agent_tests.py

# Run a specific agent test
python tests/run_agent_tests.py planner
```

### Workflow Testing

To test the different workflows, use the `test_workflows.py` script:

```bash
# Run all workflow tests with minimal complexity
python tests/test_workflows.py

# Run a specific workflow with a specific complexity
python tests/test_workflows.py --workflow tdd --complexity minimal

# List all available tests without running them
python tests/test_workflows.py --list

# Run full workflow tests with standard complexity
python tests/test_workflows.py --workflow full --complexity standard
```

#### Workflow Test Options

- **Workflow Types**:
  - `tdd`: Test-Driven Development workflow (Planning → Design → Test Writing → Implementation → Execution → Review)
  - `full`: Full Development workflow (Planning → Design → Implementation → Review)
  - `mvp_incremental`: MVP Incremental workflow - Feature-by-feature implementation with validation
  - `mvp_incremental_tdd`: Enhanced MVP Incremental with TDD - Expands vague requirements to 7+ features with full TDD cycle
  - `planning`: Execute only the planning phase
  - `design`: Execute only the design phase
  - `implementation`: Execute only the implementation phase
  - `all`: Run all workflow types (default)

  - `standard`: TODO List API with CRUD operations
  - `complex`: E-Commerce platform with multiple features
  - `stress`: Microservices architecture (most comprehensive)
  - `all`: Run all complexity levels

#### Test Monitoring and Reports

The workflow testing framework includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities:
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors each step of the workflow execution
- **Performance Metrics**: Captures timing data for each agent and step
- **Agent Interactions**: Records the sequence and patterns of agent communications
- **Review Process Analysis**: Tracks approval rates, retry patterns, and feedback loops
- **Test Artifacts**: Saves all agent outputs, generated code, and execution reports

#### Test Results and Artifacts

All test results are stored in the `tests/outputs/session_[TIMESTAMP]` directory, with:
- Agent outputs saved as individual text files
- Execution reports in JSON format
- Generated code in separate directories
- Comprehensive session report with metrics and observations

#### Working with the Executor Agent

The Executor Agent can be included in workflows to test and run the generated code:

1. Ensure `TeamMember.executor` is included in the `team_members` list of the `CodingTeamInput`
2. The Executor will:
   - Create project files in `orchestrator/generated/app_generated_[timestamp]/`
   - Set up the development environment 
   - Attempt to run the tests against the code
   - Return execution results for the reviewer to evaluate

```bash
# To view generated project files from the most recent test
cd orchestrator/generated/
ls -lt | head -5
```

### Integration Testing

For more detailed integration testing focused on executor functionality:

```bash
# Run executor direct tests
python tests/test_executor_direct.py

# Run full TDD workflow with executor integration
python tests/test_workflows.py --workflow tdd --complexity standard
```
