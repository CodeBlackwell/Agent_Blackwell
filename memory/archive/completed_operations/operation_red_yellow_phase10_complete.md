## Optimization Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Test Cache Manager (`test_cache_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Eliminate redundant test executions by caching results intelligently

**Key Features**:
- Content-based cache keys (hash of code + test files)
- Dependency tracking for smart invalidation
- LRU eviction policy with configurable limits
- Persistent cache storage option
- Feature-based cache grouping
- Automatic invalidation on file changes

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Cache hit rate (target: >80%)
- Total requests/hits/misses
- Storage size and eviction count
- Dependency graph complexity

**Test Coverage**: 19 tests passing
```python
# Example usage
cache = get_test_cache()
result = cache.get(code, test_files, feature_id)
if not result:
    result = run_tests()
    cache.set(code, test_files, result, feature_id)
```

### 2. Efficient Code Storage Manager (`code_storage_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Manage growing codebases during retry sequences without memory bloat

**Key Features**:
- Memory-first storage with automatic disk spillover
- Configurable thresholds (size and file count)
- File deduplication using content hashing
- Snapshot save/restore functionality
- Context manager support for cleanup
- CodeAccumulator for retry tracking

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Memory vs disk file distribution
- Spillover frequency
- Storage efficiency (deduplication rate)
- Retrieval performance (memory hit rate)

**Test Coverage**: 16 tests passing
```python
# Example usage
with CodeAccumulator(feature_id, memory_threshold_mb=50) as acc:
    for retry in range(max_retries):
        code_updates = generate_code()
        acc.add_retry_attempt(retry, code_updates, test_results)
    final_code = acc.get_accumulated_code()
```

### 3. Parallel Feature Processing (`parallel_processor.py`)

**Purpose**: Execute independent features concurrently while respecting dependencies

**Key Features**:

- Batch processing of independent features
- Semaphore-based concurrency control
- Circular dependency detection
- Code accumulation across parallel executions
- Configurable worker limits and timeouts

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Speedup factor vs sequential processing
- Batch count and concurrency levels
- Feature success/failure rates
- Average processing time per feature

**Test Coverage**: 20 tests passing
```python
# Example usage
processor = ParallelFeatureProcessor(max_workers=3)
if should_use_parallel_processing(features):
    results = await processor.process_features_parallel(
        features, implementer, existing_code, requirements, design
    )
    print(f"Speedup: {processor.metrics.speedup_factor}x")
```

### 4. Streaming Response Handlers (`streaming_handler.py`)

**Purpose**: Provide real-time feedback without accumulating large outputs in memory

**Key Features**:
- Async streaming with configurable buffering
- Automatic chunk splitting for large content
- Multiple subscriber support (sync/async)
- Flow control with overflow handling
- Specialized handlers for code/test output
- Progress tracking with metadata

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Chunks per second throughput
- Average chunk size
- Buffer overflow occurrences
- Stream duration and data volume

**Test Coverage**: 19 tests passing
```python
# Example usage
handler = StreamingResponseHandler()
handler.subscribe(create_console_subscriber())

async def generate_code():
    for chunk in code_parts:
        yield chunk

code = await handler.stream_code_generation(generate_code(), "file.py")
await handler.stream_progress("Testing", 0.5, feature_id)
```
