2. Enhance retry prompts with test context
3. Add test-driven fix generation
4. Update retry strategy tests

## Lessons Learned

1. **Metrics Design**: Comprehensive metrics provide valuable insights into TDD effectiveness
2. **Phase Transitions**: Clear validation ensures proper workflow progression
3. **Celebration Impact**: Positive reinforcement encourages TDD adoption
4. **Integration Complexity**: Careful coordination needed between phase orchestrators

## Code Integration Example

### TDD Feature Implementer Integration
```python
# After review approval in YELLOW phase
if impl_review.approved:
    # Collect metrics from all phases
    metrics = GreenPhaseMetrics(
        feature_id=feature_id,
        feature_title=feature_title,
        red_phase_start=phase_history[0][1],
        yellow_phase_start=yellow_context.time_entered_yellow,
        green_phase_start=datetime.now(),
        implementation_attempts=retry_count + 1,
        review_attempts=yellow_context.review_attempts,
        test_execution_count=retry_count + 2
    )
    
    # Enter GREEN phase
    green_context = green_phase_orchestrator.enter_green_phase(
        feature=testable_feature,
        metrics=metrics,
        review_approved=True,
        review_feedback=impl_review.feedback
    )
    
    # Complete feature with celebration
    completion_summary = green_phase_orchestrator.complete_feature(
        green_context,
        completion_notes=[
            "Tests written first and confirmed to fail",
            f"Implementation completed in {retry_count + 1} attempt(s)",
            "All tests passing with implementation",
            "Code reviewed and approved"
        ]
    )
    
    logger.info(completion_summary["celebration_message"])
```

## Conclusion

Phase 6 has successfully established the GREEN phase as the culmination of the TDD cycle in the MVP Incremental Workflow. The implementation provides rich metrics tracking, proper phase validation, and celebratory completion confirmation. The system now fully implements the REDâ†’YELLOWâ†’GREEN progression with comprehensive tracking at each stage.

The GREEN phase serves as both a technical milestone (approved, tested code) and a motivational checkpoint (celebration of TDD success). With detailed metrics collection, teams can analyze their TDD effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

The workflow is now ready for Phase 7, which will enhance the retry strategy to be more test-driven, using failure context to guide fixes more effectively.
