# Project Plan: Basic 'Hello World' REST API Endpoint

## Project Overview
The project aims to create a simple 'Hello World' REST API endpoint that responds with a greeting message. This will serve as a foundational step for building more complex API functionalities in the future.

## Technical Requirements
1. Programming Language: Choose a suitable language for API development (e.g., Python, Node.js).
2. Framework: Select a framework that facilitates REST API development (e.g., Flask, Express).
3. API Endpoint: Implement a single endpoint that accepts HTTP GET requests.
4. Response: The endpoint should respond with a JSON object containing a "message" key with the value "Hello, World!".
5. Testing: Include unit tests to ensure the endpoint functions as expected.
6. Documentation: Provide clear documentation on how to run the API and interact with the endpoint.

## Task Breakdown
1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Choose the programming language and framework.
   - Initialize a new project repository.

2. **Implement 'Hello World' Endpoint**
   - Create the API endpoint with the required response message.
   - Handle HTTP GET requests to the endpoint.

3. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Develop unit tests to verify the endpoint's functionality.
   - Ensure proper handling of edge cases.

4. **Documentation**
   - Write clear instructions on how to run the API locally.
   - Document the API endpoint structure and expected response.

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the API endpoint locally to confirm correct behavior.
   - Validate the response format and status codes.

6. **Review and Refinement**
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality.
   - Refactor and optimize code as needed.

7. **Final Testing and Deployment**
   - Perform final testing on the API endpoint.
   - Prepare for deployment to a chosen hosting environment.

## Architecture Recommendations
- Use a lightweight framework to keep the API simple and easy to maintain.
- Consider implementing middleware for logging, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns.
- Follow RESTful design principles for clear and consistent API structure.

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Challenges:** Address any difficulties in integrating the chosen framework with the API requirements.
- **Deployment Issues:** Ensure compatibility with the target deployment environment.
- **Security Concerns:** Implement basic security measures to protect the API from common vulnerabilities.

This project plan outlines the steps required to create a basic 'Hello World' REST API endpoint, focusing on simplicity, functionality, and maintainability.
