### Project Plan: Creating a 'Hello World' REST API Endpoint

#### Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a simple 'Hello World' REST API endpoint that responds with a greeting message. This API will serve as a foundational component for future API development projects.

#### Technical Requirements:
1. Programming Language: Choose a language suitable for REST API development (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java).
2. Framework: Select a framework that facilitates REST API development (e.g., Express.js for Node.js, Flask for Python).
3. API Endpoint: Implement a single endpoint that accepts HTTP GET requests and returns a JSON response with a greeting message.
4. Testing: Include unit tests to ensure the API endpoint functions correctly.
5. Documentation: Provide clear documentation on how to use the API.

#### Task Breakdown:
1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Install necessary tools and dependencies.
   - Initialize a new project.

2. **Choose Programming Language and Framework**
   - Research and select a suitable programming language and framework for REST API development.

3. **Implement 'Hello World' Endpoint**
   - Create a route to handle GET requests.
   - Return a JSON response with a greeting message.

4. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of the API endpoint.

5. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation detailing how to interact with the endpoint.

#### Architecture Recommendations:
- Follow RESTful principles for designing the API.
- Use appropriate error handling mechanisms.
- Consider scalability and potential future API expansions.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Dependency Risks:** Ensure compatibility between chosen language, framework, and dependencies.
- **Security Risks:** Implement basic security measures to protect the API.
- **Scalability Risks:** Design the API to be scalable for potential future growth.

Estimated Time: 1-2 weeks
Priority: Medium
