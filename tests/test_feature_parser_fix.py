## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

FEATURE[1]: Project Foundation
Description: Set up FastAPI application structure with configuration management.
Files: main.py, requirements.txt, Dockerfile
Validation: Application starts without errors and responds to requests.
Dependencies: None
Estimated Complexity: Low

FEATURE[2]: Hello World Endpoint
Description: Create a GET endpoint that returns a greeting message.
Files: main.py
Validation: Endpoint returns `{"message": "Hello, World!"}` on GET request.
Dependencies: FEATURE[1]
Estimated Complexity: Low

FEATURE[3]: Testing Suite
Description: Write unit tests for the Hello World endpoint using pytest.
Files: tests/test_main.py
Validation: All tests pass with expected output.
Dependencies: FEATURE[1], FEATURE[2]
Estimated Complexity: Medium

FEATURE[4]: API Documentation
Description: Generate OpenAPI documentation for the API.
Files: main.py (using FastAPI's built-in documentation)
Validation: Documentation is accessible and accurately describes the API.
Dependencies: FEATURE[1], FEATURE[2]
Estimated Complexity: Low

FEATURE[5]: Docker Containerization
Description: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the FastAPI application.
Files: Dockerfile
Validation: Docker image builds successfully and runs the application.
Dependencies: FEATURE[1]
Estimated Complexity: Medium
